# CrapOS Core

CrapOS Core is a library that provides core functionality for making fake OS things in LÃ–VE.

Up until now, Windows Poop Edition and CrapOS 11 have been built on top of the same messy and bodged codebase that I first started writing almost a year ago. I can only imagine how much of a nightmare it would be for anyone trying to work with it. CrapOS Core is a complete rewrite of this codebase, which I intend to be less messy, more modular, and perhaps even usable as a library for other people wishing to fulfill their dreams of creating their very own Caillou operation system. Although I'm not really sure how well that will turn out. But it is worth a shot, I guess.
