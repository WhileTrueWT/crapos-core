# CrapOS Core

This repository contains the bare minimum files for a CrapOS-like operating system. These files are at the core of OSes such as Windows Poop Edition and CrapOS 11. Although only really intended for myself and never as a public-facing API (in fact you'll probably be pulling your hair out trying to deal with my awful code), it is theoretically possible to use this as a starting-point for your own fake OS. Keyword: "theoretically".
